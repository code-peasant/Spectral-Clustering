# Spectral-Clustering
The final project of winter 15 Math 191: Graph and Network Theory at UCLA 

Unfortunately, you can't run this program in Matlab right now because the K-means Solver, which is an important part for this project is missing due to copy right reasons. I am trying to contact my professor with issue and I am waiting for his repsonse.
